Project: Predicting AIDS Virus Infection
1. Introduction:
The AIDS epidemic remains a significant global health challenge, with early detection and 
intervention playing pivotal roles in managing the disease. Leveraging artificial intelligence 
(AI) and machine learning techniques offers promising avenues for predictive modeling and 
risk assessment in healthcare. This project aims to develop a classification model to 
predict AIDS virus infection based on patient healthcare statistics and categorical 
information.
2. Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to build a robust classification model that can 
accurately predict AIDS virus infection based on various patient attributes, treatment 
histories, and medical indicators. By utilizing a dataset containing comprehensive 
information about patients diagnosed with AIDS, we aim to develop a predictive tool that 
can assist healthcare professionals in early identification and intervention strategies.
3. Dataset Description:
The dataset comprises healthcare statistics and categorical information about patients 
diagnosed with AIDS. The attributes include:
1. Time: Time to failure or censoring.
2. Treatment Indicator (trt): Indicates the treatment regimen (ZDV only, ZDV + ddI, ZDV 
+ Zal, ddI only).
3. Age: Age in years at baseline.
4. Weight (wtkg): Weight in kilograms at baseline.
5. Hemophilia (hemo): Indicator of hemophilia (0=no, 1=yes).
6. Homosexual Activity (homo): Indicator of homosexual activity (0=no, 1=yes).
7. History of IV Drug Use (drugs): History of intravenous drug use (0=no, 1=yes).
8. Karnofsky Score (karnof): Karnofsky score on a scale of 0-100.
9. Non-ZDV Antiretroviral Therapy Pre-175 (oprior): Indicator of non-ZDV antiretroviral 
therapy pre-175 (0=no, 1=yes).
10. ZDV in the 30 Days Prior to 175 (z30): Indicator of ZDV in the 30 days prior to 175 
(0=no, 1=yes).
11.Days Pre-175 Anti-Retroviral Therapy (preanti): Days pre-175 anti-retroviral therapy.
12.Race: Race (0=White, 1=non-white).
13.Gender: Gender (0=F, 1=M).
14.Antiretroviral History (str2): Antiretroviral history (0=naive, 1=experienced).
15.Antiretroviral History Stratification (strat): Antiretroviral history stratification.
16.Symptomatic Indicator (symptom): Symptomatic indicator (0=asymp, 1=symp).
17. Treatment Indicator (treat): Treatment indicator (0=ZDV only, 1=others).
18.Off-Treatment Indicator Before 96+/-5 Weeks (offtrt): Indicator of off-treatment 
before 96+/-5 weeks (0=no,1=yes).
19.CD4 Counts (cd40, cd420): CD4 counts at baseline and 20+/-5 weeks.
20.CD8 Counts (cd80, cd820): CD8 counts at baseline and 20+/-5 weeks.
21.Infected: Indicates if the patient is infected with AIDS (0=No, 1=Yes).
4. Methodology:
We propose to utilize Python programming language and popular machine learning 
libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras for model development. The 
methodology involves the following steps:
• Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, 
and encode categorical variables.
• Feature Selection: Identify relevant features using techniques such as correlation 
analysis and feature importance.
• Model Selection: Experiment with various classification algorithms such as logistic 
regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.
• Model Training: Train the selected models on the preprocessed dataset and tune 
hyperparameters using techniques like grid search and cross-validation.
• Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate 
evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
• Model Deployment: Deploy the best-performing model as a predictive tool for AIDS 
virus infection prediction.
5. Expected Outcome:
The expected outcome of this project is a well-performing classification model capable of 
accurately predicting AIDS virus infection based on patient attributes and medical 
indicators. The model can potentially assist healthcare professionals in early detection 
and intervention, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden of the 
disease.
 
6. Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project aims to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning 
techniques to develop a predictive model for AIDS virus infection. By utilizing a 
comprehensive dataset containing patient healthcare statistics and categorical 
information, we seek to contribute to the ongoing efforts in combating the AIDS epidemic 
and improving patient care.
